# Mind-Field

An RTS/city-builder hybrid visualizing mental states through four districts.

Built on [Open RTS](https://github.com/lampe-games/godot-open-rts) with inspiration from [FreeRCT](https://github.com/FreeRCT/FreeRCT) for guest AI and [Habo](https://github.com/xpavle00/Habo) for habit tracking.

## The Four Districts

- **Ivorai** (Good Memories) - Warm, golden, nurturing
- **Glyffins** (Hopes) - Geometric, precise, cool-toned
- **Zoraqians** (Bad Memories) - Alien, asymmetric, purple
- **Yagari** (Fears) - Dark, masked, shadowy

## Core Gameplay

1. Submit thoughts (snippets) to districts
2. Day Units absorb thoughts and evolve through morph stages
3. Habits improve unit stats
4. Units retire into Attendees that wander the park

## Built With

- Godot 4.3
- Inspired by Open RTS (fog of war, selection, UI)
- FreeRCT (guest AI, pathfinding)
- Habo (habit streaks, tracking)
